              I'm <span className="text-primary font-bold">Anshul Parate</span>, a Full-Stack and Generative AI Developer 
              driven by deep technical curiosity and a passion for building intelligent systems from first principles.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              My journey in software development has led me to specialize in creating advanced generative AI systems 
              that don't rely on conventional frameworks. Instead, I build from the ground up, crafting solutions 
              that are both powerful and elegant.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              With expertise in <span className="text-secondary">React</span>, <span className="text-secondary">FastAPI</span>, 
              and modern databases like <span className="text-secondary">MongoDB</span>, <span className="text-secondary">Qdrant</span>, 
              <span className="text-secondary"> Chroma</span>, and <span className="text-secondary">Neo4j</span>, I create 
              full-stack applications that seamlessly integrate AI capabilities.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              What sets my work apart is the focus on <span className="text-primary font-bold">AGNETICT AI</span> â€” 
              magnetic, self-organizing intelligence that learns and evolves without the constraints of traditional 
              AI frameworks like LangChain or LangGraph.
